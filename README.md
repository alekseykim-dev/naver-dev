# MyApp: A Node.js Application with Express, MariaDB, and External APIs

## Description

MyApp is a Node.js application that utilizes Express for server management, MariaDB for database interactions, and external APIs for data fetching and processing. The application is designed to fetch data from two different APIs, process the data, and store it in a MariaDB database. It also includes functionality to update the database based on specific conditions.

## Features

- **Express Server**: A simple Express server setup to handle HTTP requests.
- **MariaDB Integration**: Utilizes the MariaDB database for storing and retrieving data.
- **External API Integration**: Fetches data from two different external APIs.
- **Data Processing**: Processes the fetched data and prepares it for database insertion.
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Uses environment variables for configuration, ensuring sensitive information is kept secure.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for database connections and API requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MariaDB installed and configured
- An understanding of JavaScript and Node.js

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following configurations:

```env
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_PORT=your_database_port
CLIENT_ID=your_first_api_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_first_api_client_secret
API_KEY=your_second_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_second_api_secret_key
CUSTOMER_ID=your_second_api_customer_id
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials and API keys.

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the Express server on port 3000 and initiate the data fetching and processing functions.
